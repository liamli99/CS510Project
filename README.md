# CS510Project

## Introduction

Welcome to our CS510 project! In this project, we aim to help you discover delicious recipes using the ingredients you have in your refrigerator. With our application, you can simply input a list of ingredients, and we'll provide you with a variety of recipes you can make using those ingredients.
